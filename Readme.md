Experience Using GitHub Copilot
What code did Copilot generate?
Copilot generated Python code based on my comments and prompts within the files of this repository. For example, it helped scaffold functions, write logic for data processing, and even suggested docstrings and comments.

Did you modify the script?
Yes, I modified the script after Copilot's initial suggestions.
Reasons for modification:

To fix errors or improve logic suggested by Copilot.
To customize function names, variable names, and adapt the script to specific requirements.
To add exception handling and improve code readability.
How did you test it?
I tested the script by running it locally using Python.
Steps:

Installed all required dependencies noted in requirements.txt.
Ran the script from the command line:
bash
python <script_name>.py
Verified the output matched expected results and fixed any issues that appeared.
How to Run the Script
Clone the repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/indrasenareddy1/demo8.git
cd demo8
(Optional) Create a virtual environment and activate it:

bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
Install dependencies:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the script:

bash
python <script_name>.py
Replace <script_name>.py with the actual filename you want to run (e.g., main.py).

Feel free to update these sections with specific details about the files you worked on and any additional steps needed for your project! If you want me to review or generate a sample README based on your code, let me know which script(s) you used.
